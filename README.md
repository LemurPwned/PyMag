# Welcome to PyMag documentation

## Quickstart

For quick installation you only need to install the package first:

- From PyPi repository

```bash
python3 -m pip install pymag
```

- From Github repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LemurPwned/PyMag
cd PyMag
pip3 install .
```

## Running

You can launch anywhere with a simple command

```bash
python3 -m pymag run
```

It's possible to `alias` that for a quicker run:

```bash
alias pymag "python3 -m pymag run"
```

For persistence add this to your `.bashrc` if you're on Linux. On Windows you may simply create a shortcut.
